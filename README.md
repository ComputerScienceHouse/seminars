seminars
========

Seminars our members have given and would like to share the slides for.

Anyone in the CSH github group can add to this repository; ideally some sort of folder organization would also happen, probably by general topic. ("Programming"? "Systems Administration"?)

Unless otherwise stated, presentations are assumed to be represented under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3. (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)

Copies of these seminars in pdf, odp and ppt formats are available [here](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~worr/seminars/).
